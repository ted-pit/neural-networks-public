# neural-networks-public

This repository documents the process of setting up and experimenting with graph neural networks (GNNs) as part of my masters' research project.

The data cleansing and data exploration files are for preliminary visualisation of the data and removing unwanted data entries to make the input to the network as simple as possible.
